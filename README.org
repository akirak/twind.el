* Tailwind Cheatsheet for Emacs
~twind.el~ is an Emacs frontend to [[https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/][the Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet]].
Instead of opening the cheatsheet on browser, it lets you enter a class name by typing part of the CSS rule.
As the original resource says, never memorize something that you can look up.

It doesn't load your ~tailwind.config.js~.
If you have defined a custom theme, you can just type its CSS classes!
~twind.el~ is only aimed at helping with initial adoption of Tailwind.
If you want smart completion for your own Tailwind theme, you will need a language server such as [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/language-server][this one]].

** Usage
~twind-insert-class-from-cheatsheet~ command lets you insert class names by completing the built-in CSS rules of Tailwind.
You can bind the command in ~web-mode-map~, ~tsx-ts-mode-map~, etc.
It also supports multiple classes in one shot by separating rules with semicolon (~;~).

~twind-insert-css-from-cheatsheet~ command lets you insert CSS rules from the cheatsheet.
This can be used to replicate the common style in a non-Tailwind project.

It also supports referencing documentation from [[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/][the Tailwind documentation]] and [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS][MDN CSS]].
If you are using [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]], you can use the following setup:

#+begin_src elisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'embark
    (defvar-keymap twind-css-rule-embark-map
      :parent embark-general-map
      :doc "Embark keymap for twind CSS."
      "d" #'twind-reference-tailwind
      "m" #'twind-reference-mdn-css)
    (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(twind-css-rule . twind-css-rule-embark-map)))
#+end_src
